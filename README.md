<p align="center">Ease up your GitHub code review life with a bad but maybe useful practice of getting focus for your code review.</p>

## How does it work?

1. Open up your desired Pull Request and start your review in the `Files Changed` tab
2. Open your Dev-Tools and paste the whole [ignoreTheTests()](src/ignoreTheTests.js) snippet into the console
3. Enjoy your stress free focused code review

## What's up next?

We have tons of plans

* Create browser extensions so you don't have to copy paste this beast all the time
* Ease up the copy paste process with a module
* Make it customizeable to also ignore other files
* Create a Desktop App which helps you even more (no more Dev-Tools yey!)
* Try to port it to real life to be able to mark other things as viewed (or ignore them)

You see... sky is the limit... Want to contribute? We'd love to see you helping us!

## Wait... but you you said it's bad?

Of course it's bad... You should **never** conduct a review and ignore the tests – which might be the most crucial part of your system! 

To sum it up:
**Only try this approach at home if you know what you're doing**

## Ok now let's get more serious about reviews

Reviews in general are a crucial and fundamental part of your job! Whenever a review is shorter than 10 minutes (or 2 hours if it's a big change) you should ask yourself whether you paid the requester enough respect and whether you're doing your job the right way!

We'd like you to stop reading, shut down your computer, start breathing for a minute and think about your profession. :)

Tests are the core of your code. They help you maintain functionality and deliver quality.

We know it's hard to review **7.000 changed lines and 200 changed files**. We know it's hard to keep track of everything a review requires. We can only encourage you to think twice before you start skipping reviewing the core of your code!

## Why all of this?

We wanted to highlight the **importance of high quality Reviews** and how easy we tend to forget about it.

To be very honest – we use `ignoreTheTests()` from time to time. But we're **very aware** of it! Our main job over here is UI/UX Design & Development – not functional API code. You see... it all depends on the **context when taking decisions**. 

Dont forget yours!
