<p align="center">Ease up your GitHub code review life with a bad but maybe useful practice of getting focus for your code review.</p>

## How does it work?

1. Open up your desired Pull Request and start your review in the `Files Changed` tab
2. Open your Dev-Tools and paste the whole [ignoreTheTests()](src/ignoreTheTests.js) snippet into the console
3. Enjoy your stress free focused code review

## What's up next?

We have tons of plans

* Create browser extensions so you don't have to copy paste this beast all the time
* Ease up the copy paste process with a module
* Make it customizeable to also ignore other files
* Create a Desktop App which helps you even more (no more Dev-Tools yey!)
* Try to port it to real life to be able to mark other things as viewed (or ignore them)

You see... sky is the limit... Want to contribute? We'd love to see you helping us!

## Wait... but you you said it's bad?

Of course it's bad... You should **never** conduct a review and ignore the tests – which might be the most crucial part of your system! In some cases it makes complete sense tho.

To sum it up:
**Only try this approach at home if you know what you're doing**

## Ok now let's get more serious about reviews

Reviews in general are a crucial and fundamental part of your job! Whenever a review is shorter than 10 minutes (or 2 hours if it's a big change) you should ask yourself whether you paid the requester enough respect and whether you're doing your job the right way!
